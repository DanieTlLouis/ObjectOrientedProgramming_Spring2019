## Description
This course explores fundamental ideas in the design and development of software systems. Topics include abstraction, encapsulation, class inheritance, subtyping, and polymorphism. Students will learn how to use these principles to build reliable and maintanable systems. The course will also cover other asspects of software contruction such as physical software design and system architecture. 
These design and architeture ideas require programming language support. The course will be primarily taught using C++, but important features in other popular languages (notably Java and C#) will also be discussed. 

## Objectives 
* Understand the differnece between values, objects, and types
* Learn how classes and other user-definded types support abstraction
* Know how to encapsulate ideas to hide implementation details
* Learn how to represent abtract and concrete entities using classes
* Understand subtypes and implementation inheritance and when thier uses are appropriate
* Understand dynamic dispatch, especially through virtual functions 
* Understand generic programming and its relationship with object-oriented programming 
* Apply this knowledge to build interesting and useful applications
