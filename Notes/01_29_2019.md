* War game encashment on BS
  * Due feb 5
  * Have abstraction called player
  * Should be no more than 50 lines
  * War can be recursive
  * Have a readme file to describe it 
  * Put it in sub directory
  * Also do milestone one and choose a game to work on 
    * Need SFML installed on computer
      * Just look up sfml 
      * Simple enough to get started quickly
      * Itss gui stuff
      * Get windows subsystems for linux 
        * Gives you command line in windows 
      * Got a week to do it
      * Might have access to VS studio through university
        * Imagin
* #pragma once
  * Similar to include guards 
    * These prevents adding the same text to one text multiple times
  * Shorter way to do the same thing 
    * Not part of the language 
    * It is windows extension but everyone uses it
* Don't need trailing comma in enums
  * But it makes nice anchor for multiple selection
* Only write a makefile if you don’t have better solution
  * We have better ways now 
  * Gcc is C compiler but is smart to switch to c++ if it sees its needed 
  * There’s also clang
  * This is not a good way to compile but you can't just do it through the command line
    * Dumps build files in same directory as source code
      * This is not desigered 
      * Anything created in compilation should never be added to your repository
  * -E 
    * Will show the intermediate file when compiling
      * Replace -c with -E
      * | wc-l 
        * Will let you see lines of code
  * -s
    * Will also show what is being done cmake instead
  * Use cmake instead
    * It will generate the makefile
    * Can open CMakeLists.txt
      * add_exicutable (name *.cpp, main.cpp)
    * Always put it into a subdirectory
      * Call it build
    * Then run it cmake ..
      * The .. is to jump up a level
    * Ccmake
      * Is a function to pull up a program to find all
        * 2 build types
          * Debug
            * Type it into use 
            * To debug it if it crashes
    * rm -rf build to clean the build
    * Can compile for release as well
      * For better optimization
* For the game also grabe the cmake directory it will find it and work on system
  * Enums class Suit{};
    * Will force namespace rules so you call it like 
      * Suit::Hearts
  * Our fake enum will effectively catch problem as runtime but enum catch it on compile time error
    * So no one can compile it wrong 
    * It becomes a type error
      * We should be able to make it a type error for common errors
  * With war design the program to be incorrect when run if used wrongly
