Json (continued) 
* Is a data language 
* Everything in json is a value
* Object are sets of key and value pairs 
  * A map 
  * {
    * “Data” : {
      * “After” : “value … 
  * Is an object that has a key value pair of a key data and an object as value 
  * The floating { declares an object 
  * This makes a tree of the object 
  * This is a recursive structures
    * How do we tell the size of the tree?
  * Height of tree is node with greatest depth 
    * height(v) = { o if v is in {null, bool, string, numbers}, if A height is v is obj, if A height is v is array
* Last class made json in cpp looks like 
  * Jason.hpp if its on his repository 
    * Under json
  * set(CXX_Cmake_Flags “ std = cpp14”)
    * Not quite but close to get compiler 
    * Cmake lists
  * Json.cpp
    * Is a parser for json 
  * C IN  take input string to get 
    * A look at his 
    * Is streambuf is what buffers the input and output
      * We can read through that 
  * When adding argument to main add [] to arg so it does not need one (I think )
    * > out will automatically put it out to a file
    * Json < … /cpp.json | more
      * Is piping which will page the output for us 
      * Input redirection, output, piping 
      * Unix commands 
  * Computer size of value in json.hpp
    * Int size(value * val);
    * {
      * if(val is null)
        * Return 1;
      * if(val is bool)
        * Return 1; // same with num string, but we cant do this for array or obj but we can use dynamic_cast<>()
           * Only works on polymorphic types 
         * if (null const * n = dynamic_cast<null  const *>(v)
           * If v was null it can be returned as null else it will be returned as 0
           * Can do this for all of them except object and array
         * Don't need to store value just ask 
           * if(dynamic_cast<null const *>(v)
           * if(dynaimc_cast<number const*>(v)
         * At end 
           * assert(false_;//since it was not a type logic error there was a type of values not addressed 
       * Can add custom values from json and we would have to add more if statement to address this 
         * Can add pc address as literal instead of string 
           * For instance 
         * Can change number to decipher what it is int, float, ect. 
         * But each new one needs new if in size also search one it needs to check if true or not so it should check with a switch instead 
           * “But a switch does not work”
           * It also does not change the float we have to add new cases when added features to the values 
  * We can defer the object itself with virtual functions
    * Return v->size()
  * Struct value {
    * …
    * Virtual int size() const { return 1;}
    * //to return one for the ones that are one not put so we don't have to copy the same one over a bunch but for array and object if needs to be different 
    * Array
      * Int size() const override{
        * Int n = 1;
        * For (auto const & : *this)
          * N += v->size();
        * Return n;}
    * Object need to iterate over key value pairs so it a little different 
  * Do same for height 
    * For virtual return 0 since leaf node is 0 
    * Array is trickier
      * Int height () const override{
        * Int n = std::max_element(begin(), end(), [](value* a, value* b){
          * Return a->height() < b->height();
          * })return 1+n;
          * (not value* its const_iterator)
          * Lambda function 
            * Can have function call to help compare 
            * Function passed as argument 
            * Look up lambda expressions 
  * Value_type is standard pair of walter 
    * So for object can use that instead of value * a
      * Value_type const* a
  * Now we want to print and it has to be pure virtual 
    * But we keep pushing function into value we are not separating the class, it was just a representation of value but now has a wanted down abstraction 
    * We want to take it out of the abstraction but we want to dynamic thing 
      * Print
        * Virtual void print(std::ostream & os, int tab) = 0;
          * We tab everything out as well so it will print spaces for tab depth but this is passed around 6 virtual function so we need the tab depth to increment one for each sequence call and decrement one when you get back 
      * Struct bool{
        * Void print(std::ostream & os,int tab) const override {
      * Void
        * indent(std::ostream & os, int tab)
        * {
          * os<<std::string(2*(tab), ‘ ‘);
          * //will create 2 spaces for every tab
        * }
        * Void string(std::ostream & os, int tab)
        * { 
          * indent(os, tab);
          * os<<’u’<<*this<<’”’;
        * }
