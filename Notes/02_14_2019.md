* Midterm next thursday
  * One programming code to write on paper
  * Everything else short answer
    * 6 questions plus programming roughly
  * Know values, objects, types and how they relate
    * Value is element of a set
      * Is an abstraction represented by bits in the machine
    * Elements of programing
      * Good book
    * Object is region of memory
      * That holds values and functions
    * Types of sets of values 
      * Tells us how we represent the value in a computer as well
  * If you have an object and its type use interpret what it is
    * We don't always care about the bits but rather what the interpretation of the bits are
  * Code routine
    * Will remember where you are so when going back into it is does not start at beginning 
    * Random num is one since it keeps moving forward every time it pushes a number out the seed is set before the program runs and it remembers where it was along the seed each time it sends a “random” number
  * Abstraction, encapsulation
    * Abstracting away form details
    * Abstraction is lifting away from details and encapsulation is locking down the details
    * Abstraction mechanism is anything that allows you to make an abstraction in the language
      * Class, struct, enum
    * Encapsulation mechanism is anything in the language that limits access
      * Const (kind of) , private (definitely)
    * Enums
      * Is a set of values
        * Has underlying set of values of ints to represent it
      * Has type safety by not allowing any outside declarations
    * Safety guard rails for a program
      * Prevents user from commenting logic errors
  * Try not to use array	
    * Not regular types 
    * To open and are weird
  * Assertion is for runtime error
    * Type safety is for compile time error 
  * Gcc debug will compile with different standard lib to check your code more
    * Need to write simple class 
      * 10-15 lines of code
      * Define overloaded operator
* Another practice
  * Practice 4
  * Implement two version of the playing card class, which combines both standard card and jokers 
    * 8 bit representation with joker
    * And the one with enums
  * Due feb 28
* Project milestone 2
  * Due feb 28
  * Create branches for refactoring
  * In event there's an enum that says all of them 
    * SFML event
      * Class is a giant tagged union
