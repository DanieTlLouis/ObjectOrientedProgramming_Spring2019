C++20
* New c++
* Will have modulus 
  * No more include 
  * Instead write import std 
     * Partially compiled reposantion of your source code
     * You only export what you need no the while file
        * Encapsulation
     * No more header or source files 
     * Links to files that owns it instead of copying it over
     *Define by top of file 
        * Export module x
            * Export class card{
            * Union card data(){
                * Since no export it wont and effectively be private
* Code runtime
  * Like subroutine (function call)
  * Generics the call 
    * Can resume execution from where the function was 
  * Yield key word C# 
    * While it yields it returns to caller and then is called again and wont start at beginning but start at the yield point 
  * 2 routines that execute simultaneously 
* std::Tuple<T1, T2, T3,...> T=...
  * Holds “pairs” of data 
  * But for loops to print does not work 
     * for(auto x:T){
       * Cout << x;}
       * Will not work since x can’t change 
  * New feature 
    * For … (auto x : t)
      * Will expand it for everything and it would work 
    * Tuple is already there 
    * Also works on structs 
      * Struct car{Rankr; Suit s;};
        * Card c{...}
        * For … (auto x : c)
        
Discriminate unions
* Variant of 2 types is called an Either 
Either 
Double sqrt(double n);
If n is negative it would be an error 
Can throw an exception 
But that is runtime 
Can change it to 	
Expected (double, orr) sqrt(double n);
The expected value facility 
Either < A>, Either <B , C> 
A or (A or B)
Same as 
Either <Either<A,B>,C
(AorB)orC
Same set of values 
Access them differently through in the language 
Same with pair
pair<A, pair<B,C>>  
A and (B and C)
When sqrt is negative it return NaN (Not a Number) and is bits of garbage
optional<int> 
Will say maybe its a value or NaN
Same with pointer can be null
So it can return nothing 
If sec it might not be int
In error handling it move expresses what code is doing 
Either maybe
It is either one thing or nothing 
Optional helps define the nothing 
Inheritance
Struct deck : vector<card> {}
Says this dec will be velcro with all public vars be in deck that are in vector 
So deck is effectively a vector
Establish relation between two classes 
Allows you to add new things to code for new altnatials 
If you have stangard card class you can inherit from card 
Struct card {};
Struct SC: Card{};
Struct jc : card {};
Card is empty class that represejts all possible playing cards 
So all values of cards can be addressed there
Example
Hierarchy of classes 
Struct card {};
Struct standardCard : card { };
Struct unoCard : card { };
Struct wildCard : unoCard { };
Standard card derives card from class 
Card is the base class (supper class) 
Standard card ios the derived class (Sub class)
Supper type / sub type
Card denotes a set of values
Does not hold sets of values 
It is an abstract set of values whose concrete values are defined by their derived class 
Struct deck : std::deque<card>
Does not work since card is empty and needs something 
Can use pointer to say its a card type so all subclass of card will work
Struct deck : std::deque<card*>
Then to declare them it needs to be dynamically allocated 
New standardCard {ace, spades};
Giant memory leak
No destructor in deck to delete them
Will not compile with { }
Need to make constructor for standardCard to call with rank suit 
Might work now I haven’t there already
We are effectively making a container of different types 
Pointers pointing to different like objects 
So to add something to game a hierarchy could be good to add new things without changing what we have 
Don't change pointer to base class of bad things will happen
Cat for card will break with pass by value
Can always convert pointer from derived class to base class
StandardCard *s = new SC(A,S);
jokerCArd *j = new JC(Red);
Card *p = s;
Card &r = s;
Can also do a reference so r is now a reference of the card 
Can not go other way
SC *S2 = p;
We don't know if p is SC or JC
We can always go broader but more specific could be tricky
You can also do 
Card c = *s;
But there is danger
It declards new object that is empty and converts one with date to one without	
The data is best and card is still copied but is empty 
Called object slicing
Slicing off objects
Can’t card will slice off data and have nothing to output
Pass by reference instead card const & c
