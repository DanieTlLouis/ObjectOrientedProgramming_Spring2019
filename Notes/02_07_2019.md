* Practice extra make big number print english spelling
  * Keep dividing by 10 and map it back on to the words
* To find how many bits it takes to store a number take log base 2 of it
* Can we take integer value and direct the order of a deck from it
  * It is 52! Amount of ways a deck can be shuffled
  * There is no good way of doing it
  * Can we swap out Rank and Suit with something more compact
  * SizeOf(); will tell you how many bits it is
    * Cards are 8 bytes the way we did it
    * Can we compact it 
    * Having private data members we can redesign the class to do it without having their implementation to change
    * We can represent suit as 2 bits
      * 00,01,10,11
   * Unsigned char data;
      * //is 8 bits
      * //stores the rank and suit as follows
      * \* can make them multiples of 10s so spades would be 0’s and hearts would be 10’s and so on
        * Then comparing cards would be easier to compare the higher num
          * If suits are ranked as well
      * Bit manipulation to unsigned char
        * //00ssrrrr
        * //where ss are the two bits needed to store the sui
        * //and rrrr is the four bits needed to store the rank
          * Left shift multiply it by 2 need it to shift 2 times so multiply it by 4
  * Card(Rank r, Suit s)
    * data(static_cast\<unsigned\>(s) << 4|static_cast\<unsigned\>(r))
      * a\<\<left shift
      * Second r does not be shifted it is 0-12
      * | bitwise or
        * 1 or 1 is 1
        * 1 or 0 is 1
        * But with bits so it is 1s and 0s
        * Van combine bits and bit masking
      * Bitwise operation is a lot faster than integer multiplication and division
        * Division is slow
  * Rank get_rank() const {return static_cast\<Ran\k>(data &0xf);
    * & mask of and
      * 1 and 1 is 1
      * 1 and 0 is 0
    * Now we are selecting the low 4 bits and getting the rank and converting it to that
  * Suit get_suit() const {return static_cast\<Suit\>(data >> 4);}
    * Any bits at end that fall off dont get cycled around just become 0s
  * Struct Deck : std::array\<Card,52\>
    * Lot less bits
    * Using std::array<\Card.52\>
      * Not a thing so
      1. Deck(initilization_list\<Card\>list)
      2. {
 	    3.    std::copy(list.begin(), list.end(), begin());
      4. }
  * Sometimes you need a default constructor 
    * We now only need 52 bits of data for our program which was at least 52X8 larger
      * So making them private we can change it without changing how it works
    * It is no unmuttable though
      * Can’t take off top or put on bottom new
* Classes
  * Can represent some value abstructly
  * Card does not have mutable numbers after initialization
  * Helps with abstract representation
    * Rational number class shouldn’t have 0 on bottom so it needs to catch that do you reduce the rational num or learn it as original fraction
  * Data structures
    * All mutable is someway 
      * Can be modified in some way
  * Also has mutable data
    * Datas that can be changed over time
    * Like player health
    * Concrete entities
  * Resources
    * Anything will limited access of them 
    * Memory
  * Function
    * Machine devices
  * These are the parts of a class and what a class can hold
  * To hand off function to other sub processes
    * You can add a third argument to sort as a function 
      * f() 
        * Has back one.author < book2.author
      * sort(x.begin(), x.end(), f());
* Practice 3
  * Due feb 14
  * Could make it for every card game
    * With generalized functions that are shared between games
