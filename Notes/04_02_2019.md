* Midterm review
  * Tagged union
  * Inheritance
  * Virtual functions
    * What doe and how used
  * Public private protected inheritance
  * Static and dynamic types
  * Dis of virtual functions and pure virtual functions
    * Virtual may be overwritten but pure virtual must be 
    * Polymorphic has at least one virtual function
    * Abstract class has at least one pure virtual function
    * Every polymorphic class has a pointer to the virtual table
    * Can’t create an object of an abstract type
    * Write abstract class to organize an abstract set of values that otherwise would not be an object to be used 
      * Parts of multiple classes 
        * Card has values but is not the class
  * Tagged union 
    * Playing cards is either joker of sc but not both
      * Provide method of representing alternatives
  * Inheritance
    * Effectively same problem solved by tagged 
    * Representing a set of alternatives
  * Functional languages only have variance and unions to inheritance
  * Why choose between the two
    * If set of variance won't grow then variant is good but inheritance is growing it is better
    * If object is returned by value then variance is better 
      * But if never passes then inheritance is better 
    * If data is recursive then you want inheritance hierarchy and not variance
  * Static dynamic types
    * Static type is never changing or fixed types
    * Dynamic type whatever is referred to when called. The runtime type 
      * f(value & v)
        * V is static value
      * If called with f*new number(...))
        * Then the dynamic type of v is number 
      * Behavior of function depends on dynamic type of V
        * Cout \<\< V; with depend on if it value or number to see what it does 
      * This is a polymorphic behavior
        * Its behavior is defined by the type provided 
    * Polymorphic type has polymorphic functions
  * Interface
    * C# and have
      * Abstract class with pure virtual functions 
      * Allows the change of implementation without change of usability 
        * User -> interface<- implementation 
* Not test
* Json storage
  * Struct value { ~value(){} };
  * Struct array : value, vector<value *> { ~Array()} 
    * Array(int n) : value(), vector<value *> (n)
    * {}
    * //this allows the vector to set size to n
    * //vec\<int\>(100) will create 100 elements 
   * //left shift by n is 1 + 2^20 for new array(16620)
  * };
  * kill(new Array(16620))
    * Void kill(value * p) {
      * Delete P}
    * What destructor is called the array of the value? The destructor is not virtual so it calls the base case and it deallocated pointer and not leaked that memory
    * If virtual function in base class it needs virtual ~value() {} in the base class
      * You better have a virtual destructor  
      * Don't have virtual destructor if not polymorphic class
  * Make copy of value class we give pointer to a value value * copy (value * p) will return a copy of P that is distinct so we can modify on without affecting the other
  * Value * copy (value * P) {
    * //return new? (*P); // we don't know what type the ? is
    * return p->clone();
      * //is a virtual function that returns a copy
  * Struct value { 
    * Virtual value * clone () const = 0;
  * Struct Array : value, vector<value *>
  * {
    * Array * clone() const override
    * {
      * Return new Array(*this);
    * }
  * };
    * This is a virtual constructor pattern 
      * Constructors can’t be virtual so need this pattern
