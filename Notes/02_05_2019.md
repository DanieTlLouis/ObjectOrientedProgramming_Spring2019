* Random numbers
  * Don't do rand srand its the old way 
  * Class inheritance
    * struct Deck: std::deque\<Cards\>
      * Make it have all the elements of a standard deque class
    * Inheritance all operations and everything 
      * Everything but constructors and destructors
      * using std::deque\<Card\>
        * Will bring over the constructor and destructor
      * Remember deque is a doubly linked list of arrays 
      * Make useful functions for classes is not a bad idea even if you don't use it
        * Keep the print next time
    * For (Card c:d)
        * Is equal to
          * for(auto iter = d.begin(); iter != d.end(); ++iter)
            * C and c=*iter;
        * Called ranged based loop
* Rand num
  * Need random bit generator / random number generator
    * Std::minstd_rand;
      * Is a pseudo random num always generating the same sequence with a starting point
      * Useful for testing so it's always the same initial state
        * To see the same replay to find bug
    * Std::random::device rng;
      * May or may not have on computer
      * Draws on entropy pool on machine
        * This candrain so it can run out of the random
  * Need distribution system for random
    * Probability distribution
    * Shape binary data to distribution 
  * Std::shuffle
    * Has 3rd argument for random distribution
    * Can user minstd_rand prg;
    * std::shuffle(d.begin(), d.end(), prg);
  * If you want to get a password then use random device since it will be random dont use minstd_rand since it won't be truly random and can be tracked 
    * #include \<random\>
  * Std::minstd_rand prg(std::time(nullptr);
    * Will initialize with time 
    * But will be same if run in same time so don’t use it
  * To sort the deck 
    * std::sort(d.begin(), d.end());
      * Need to compare values to sort through
        * Cards can’t be evaluated
* Encapsulation
  * Don't want to change a card value after creating it
  * Could try to make it const
    * Const Rank
    * Const Suit
    * But shuffle needs to modify the objects 
  * Can also make it private
    * Make it a class
    * But makes the constructor not work since its trying to initialize a private in ember
  * As you start to look things down the more code you will need to write
  1. class Card{
  2. public:
 	3.   Card(Rank r, Suit s)
 	4.  	: rank(r), suit(s)
 	5.   {
 	6.   //can't do this 
 	7. 	   //rank = r;
 	8. 	   //suit = s;
  9.   //that's the java way
      * It is reinitializing them again after initializing them so it should be initialized from the start
        * This is not initialization it is an assignment. Will make them twice so learn good way
          * It is performance issues so learn good way
  1. {
 	2.          //need to make an accessor for the print out to read it
 	3.          Rank get_rank() const{ return rank; }
            * It won't modify the things
            * These are “const” guarantees 
            * Also can not call any non const member function
  * Suit get_suit() const { return Suit; }
  * Or you could have declared it as a friend   
    * Only do it with caution
    * Mostly just leave it to the class to handle
  * If you put in a setter then why make it private to begin with
  * void set_rank(Rank r) { rank = r; }
  * But if you want to put a guard on the function to control range of values 
    * So it can be private with a function to mod it
    * But if you don’t ever change it then don't add the setter
      * Ace of spades will always be the ace of spades
  * Think before you create mutators
    * Observers or getters are always a good idea to have
* Sorting
  * Objects have to be mutable so it can be changed 
  * It has to be compared so it can sort the value of the object
    * But what values is important to sort by
  * Need to be able to tell one is less than another
    * To sort by ascending order
 * Need to satisfy the tricadomy law
    * a<b
    * a>b
    * a==b
    * One of these have to hold without the other two being true
  * For Card define the overloaded operations
    * bool operator==(Card a, Card b);
      * If you have one the other should be the opposite
    1. bool
    2. operator==(Card a, Card b)
    3. {
 	  4.    //for entire value of card not just for game of war so suit matters
 	  5.    return a.get_rank() == b.get_rank() && 
 		6.        a.get_suit == b.get_suit();
    7. bool 
    8. operator!=(Card a, Card b)
    9. {
 	  10.       return !(a==b);
 	  11.       //when is a!=b is when a does not equal b
    12. }
    * Don't care where they live in memory just the value
      * Value oriented program 
      * Worry about what they do not how they work
      * Java compares addresses first to see if they are from the same place
        * Bad on performance
        * We don't care where they live just what their value is
      * Can reduce things mathematical so we can maximize the complexity from the value
          * ini=n(n+1)2
          * Which is a lot faster bitwise shift
          * For getting the computer need to give a value more weight to have the first order happen then the second comparison
              * I.e. suits more important than rank
              * This is a lexicographical order
                * Like string comparison
                * Need to keep going until it is finished 
* Product order is not total order
  * return a.fet_rank() < b.get_rank()
 	*           && a.get_Suit() < a.get_suit()
* Instead do if statement
  1. if(a.get_suit() < b.get_suit())
  2. {
 	3.      return true;
  5. }
  5. else if ….
