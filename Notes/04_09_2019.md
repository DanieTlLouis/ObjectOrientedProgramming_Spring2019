* Defensive programing 
  * Adding guards to prevent user for misusing it at least while you are testing it 
    * Shipping usually does not ship with guards turned on
* Design by contract 
  * People providing implementation are the reader 
  * And users are clients
  * This is a contract between the two parties 
  * We are not implementations of the standard library we are the consumers of that library
  * If I call a function (correctly) what guarantee do I get ( how it will / should function)
  * 2 function expectations
    * Preconditions, postcondition
    * Preconditions
      * What needs to be true before calling this function
    * Postcondition 
      * What will outcome of the function be
  * If you satisfy the precondition I promise this postcondition will happen
    * A trabut on function is something to look at it with the functions
      * Double sqrt(double N)
          * [[pre : N >= 0]]
      * So now sqrt(-1)
        * Will not satisfy the precondition sqrt(-1) normal returns Nan so it does not break just sends Man back
          * Leads to unpredictable behavior
      * Compiler can now act on the pre: so if it is false it can handle it
      * Can do same as pre with post
        * Post takes identifier of what result is (R)
        * [[post R: R*R==N]]
          * If R*R != N abort  / terminate
          * Can provide a way to handle it but default is terminate
          * Calls
            * if(!(N>=0)
            * {
 	            * on_compares();
 	            * Terminate();
            * }
  * Double sqrt(double N)
    * [[pre : N > = 0 ]]
    * [[post R: R*R==N]]
    * [[assert : e]]//c++20
      * The post calls
        * if(!(R*R==N) …
  * Global var gets a bit weird 
  * If you have N in pre and post N should not change
    * It can fail if N changed then post will be wrong
      * Undefined behavior
  * Ex : sort(vector<double> & v);
    * Sorting a vector of double(v)
    * Precondinot nothing in the vector can be Nan
      * If you compare 2 Nans Nan < Nan 
        * It is false same number is not less than itself
        * However, 
          * If you compare 2 Nans
            * Nan<= Nan
              * Is false
            * Nan == Nan
              * Is false
            * Nan != Nan 
              * Is false
            * It is both equal to itself and not equal to itself
      * Can call none of to prevent that 
 * sqrt((vec<double> & v)
    * [[pre: std::None_of(v, [](double) {return std::isNan(N);})]]
    * Post condition
      * V needs to be sorted and has all same elements
        * V is the permutation of V
      * Just cuz you can write past does not mean you can in a clean way so it should not always be done
    * Cow data stature 
      * Copy and write data struct nic in single thread environment but not nice in multithreaded environment 
      * Has pointer that only creates new when changed
        * Look this up
      * Hash tables has a program that only has rate of collision be 1/n n=size of input
        * So the strings does not collide with another often 
        * Now do we check this post condition effectively
          * We do not
    * Int * Distance( int * f, int * l)
      * Return l-f;
      * Find distance between 2 elements in a range
        * For finding middle of vectors or containers
      * But this works
        * In x, y;
        * Distance(&x, &y);
          * But that is garbage data
            * Effective undefined behavior
              * No guarantee where they will ies in memory 
              * So there is a precondition
      * [pre: Axiom: is_reachable(f,l)]]
          * //is_reachable makes sure you can 
          * //reach f from l
        * Axiom is something we can’t define f can be incremented to find l
          * Way to write a scape hatch to unspillable conditions
      * Pre and post is mostly c++ and adia (another language) 
        * To think of this ask what behavior we want to do
          * How costly are the tests to check 
          * And should they be there after release or not
        * Topological sort
          * Can find the dependent and cycles to find what needs to happen before something else
            * Used for paralyzation (parallel  compiling)
    * Audit 
      * Audit : is if its expensive
      * Default : is cheap
      * Axion : is infinite expensive
        * [[pre Audit : … ]]
      * Can tell the compiler to assume it is true
        * For optimization
          * [[asume: P != 0]]
            * if(P)
            * Sort
            * *p
          * So now if(p) and sort is true it does not do it anymore
          * Time travel optimization
      * Pre and post if they are false it does not automatically break so it becomes undefined 	
        * So it optimizes but is not desired. (cautious when using)
* Contracts come in 2 flavors
  * Wide contracts & narrow contracts -> pertains to pre and post conditions
  * Wide:
    * Wide can handle multiple things so it can be larger range of values as input
  * Narrow:
    * Will terminate if it is outside the narrow scope of inputs
  * If multiplying max x max it is undefined behavior 
    * It has no guarantees to wrap that overflow making it negative 
      * It is undefined 
  * Wide version of sqrt does not have preconditions it accepts everything
    * Double sqrt(double N)
      * [[pre: true]]//does N >= 0 -> T
        * It's always true
        * But true does not imply that N >= 0
        * T is typology (discrete math) 
      * [[post R : R*R == N]] 
    * More from narrow to wide weakens the precondition and strengthen post condition 
      * [[post R : R * R == N ]]
        * if(N>=0)
          * R*R==N;
        * Else
          * isNan(R);
  * After release of ver 1 with ver 2 should you widen sqrt?
    * Yes i’m still in contract to say your input still works just more does too
    * Other way does not cuz you break contract to say what used to work now does not work 
    * Javascript sqrt
      * Function sqrt(N)
        * Takes and N 
          * Including string and arrays and extra
        * sqrt(“Pie")
          * Works but does not return the right answer but rather the sqrt of the ascii code of pi symbol 
        * If you strengthen the precondition you will break someone else's code
          * If you ship it someone will use it “incorrectly” so if you narrow it that person still will used it wrong but will break their code
  * Adding functionality won't break code but removing functionality will 	
* Think of software as rings
  * Wide contracts need to exist on the outer riges 
    * Has to accept everything first you validate it then check if its what you want 
* v[N]
  * Is narrow if n is outside it crashes
  * v.at(N)
    * Widder it throws exception if N is outside of the array
    * Sort using .At then it is a huge number of checks you don't need to do 
      * Huge performance hit
* Self documenting code 
  * B.s. talk on this later
