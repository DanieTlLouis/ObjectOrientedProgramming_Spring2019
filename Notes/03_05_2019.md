Virtual functions 
* Declares operations in base class but defines behavior in derived class 
* Definition if a class has virtual function it is a polymorphic type 
  * All that defines polymorphic if it has it then it is poly if not then not 
* Pure virtual 
  * =0 at end of virtual 
  * A definition of what to call but has no functionality in itself 
  * Abstract function
    * Once one is made the class is now abstract class and can not implicitly construct that class anymore 
* If there is a reasonable default behavior than it does not be pure virtual 
  * Derived class does not have to override default this way 
    * For abstract functions it must have an override in the derived class 
* If derived class inherits polymorphic class then it is polymorphic 
  * Struct A{
    * Virtual void f()=0;}//abstract class
  * Struct C : B{ //only poly not abstract
    * Void f() override()}};
  * B inherits everything from A so since A has pure virtual B also does since there was no override so it no longer is pure virtual 
* Card class to see card isStandard
  * Give it a default to return false and in standard card to return true with override 
  * Virtual bool is_sc() const{
     * Return false;}
  * SC
     * Bool is_sc() const override{
         * Return true;}
* What we are saying is there is a piece wise 
  * get_color(c)={suitColor(c.suit) if c is a sc and c.color if c is jc
* How they work
  * Grabs address of function void f(int n);
     * voit(*p)(int)=f;
        * Declares p to be pointer of function that takes int and returns a void
        * Then can be used as function name 
           * p(0);
           * f(h);//works the same 
           * Auto 
           * p=f;
              * Will do same thing
        * Override becomes indirect calls to functions that we need 
        * The compiler will write them like non member functions with explicit perimeter
           * Has (const * this)
           * Will then just look at it like a function
              * Struct{
                  * {void f() const;
                  * Void g();};
              * Void f(sc const* this)// not finished 
* Code example
  * Struct card{
    * Void print(std::ostream& os const){
       * print_fn(this,os);
    * }
    * void(*print_fn)(card const*j,std::ostream &)= 0;
       * //pointer tp [rint_fn c
       * //=0 sets pointer to null in that 
       * //class so in derived ti can be set
       * //put print_fn = nullptr in constructor
       * //instead of =0
          * // be more explicit
  * ruct sc :card{
     * ...
     * print override
     * atic void print(card * this _, std::ostream &os);
         * //static member is not prat of the 
         * //object but is contained with init
            * Way to scope it into the class
  * Actually override it in SC constructor by putting print_fn = print; //print will be the newly made one in the class
  * Need to static cast pointer of card back to sc or it will fo to infinite loop 
  * To cut down memory 
     * We hash them to a table to 
        * Since it only has 2 optimize of being sc or jc and the values over print do not change 
  * Every polymorphic class has a table attached to it so the derived class can point to the table 	
     * Struct carVtable{
        * void(*print_fn)(card const*, std::ostream&)=0
           * //if pur virtual it is =0
           * //if not put it is = what the default function is 
        * };
        * Theres a print global object to be called from everywhere 
           * Card virtual table card_c+bl;
        * Lectern global variable declares the variable object does not declare it yet nor allocates memory yet just says its there
