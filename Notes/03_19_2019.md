Milestone 3
* Extend game and add feature 
* Fix game window resize bug 
  * Geometry was wrong 
* Due : april 9th

Practice 6:
* Implement json data structure (via inheritance) 
* Use his parser
* Website scraper 
  * Look at what reddit returns and pars through that to get info 
  * No brut force search
    * Instead data structures (container) of what a reddit post is 
    * Post should be a class
      * Could be abstract to go through what different posts from reddit 
        * Video, pics, text, posts
        * Should be derived classes
  * Due april 2nd
* Json input from reddit is by taking .json at end of url 
  * reddit .com.json
    * Get main page json
  * Every post has .json extension on reddit 
* Comments could be its own class
  * Linked comments how do you represent the link 
    * Repost post repost 
  * Not needed but cool
   
Json print
* Have 3 functions to over bad it to say if we need a comma we put it otherwise don't
  * This is straight forward but ugly with the amount of compliments 
* Arrays and objects are the only really complicated parts. Look at his code
  * In order not to have a lot of arguments to carry over you can make a class holding it
    * //a context object
    * Struct print context {
      * Ostream os;
      * Bool inline;
      * …
    * } 
    * Virtual void print (print context & cxt){ }
  * This is a design pattern
    * Context object design 
  * Web servers usually have a lot of context objects about what is going through to people and servers 
* Separation of concerns 
  * The idea that the concerns are not woven into one cohesive design 
  * This that we did we failed to separate out a hole bunch of concerns 
    * Its all one data structure 
* Can we take the algorithms and factor them out of the class 
  * Yes with the visitor pattern
  
Visitor pattern
* Look at polymorphic dynamic type the jump to that type and execute a behavior of that table 
* Like out switch that does not work to check what v is
* We make the table it is called visitor 
  * Struct visitor{
    * //bunch of virtual functions called visit 
    * Virtual void visit_null(null const & n);
    * …
    * Virtual void visit_object(object const & o);
  * C++ version is over load then 
    * Virtual void visit (null const & n);
    * Virtual void visit(bool const & b);
  * Then to get the type we make function accept 
    * Virtual acceptance visitor & vis)=0;
      * Pure virtual and accepts visions into table 
        * It just calls visit 
  * All have same behaven
    * Void accept(visitor & vis) override{
      * Return vis.visit(*this)}
      * This is in the derived class null : value 
  * “Sufficing the dynamic type” so you know it from the function call 
  * Now need to fill in the table with behavior with derived visitors
    * Struct size visitor : visitor {
      * Virtual visit(null const & n) override { return 1;} 
      * That is essentially is 
        * switch(v)
          * Case : null return 1;
      * Return type is void but still returns something since it returns anything 
      * To fix the return we catch it in the function 
        * Bcd ret = 0;
      * Void visit(null const & n) override { let = 1; }
      * With in the struct size visitor 
  * So for the size function it is just 
    * Size visitor vis;
      * Vis accept (vis)
      * Return vis.ret;
  * Lot to put together and is not an easy design pattern
  
Expression problem 
* We have 2 kinds of approta
  * Data structures 
  * Algorithms 
* If we want to extend data structures but everytime we do it we hand to change algorithms 
  * Virtual functions help as not have to do it
  * But if we want to add a new algorithm can we do that without changing code
    * Still need to add virtual function and change data structure 
* If we had a good separation of concerns we would not have to change our source code 
* There are no language feature that allows use to do it
  * One that was proposed to c++ 
    * Open multi methods 
    * Multiple polymorphism arguments 
      * Multiple this arguments
