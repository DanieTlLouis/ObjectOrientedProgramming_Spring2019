Virtual functions (continued)
* Void *
  * Is a function type 
  * Cant create void but its a pointer to void 
  * Can point to anything but needs to know what it is to dereference 
      * If dereferenced as wrong thing you get underlined behavior
* void(*)()
  * Is a pointer to void function so it can point to only function
  * These can be put into an array to hold all types of the function pointer
* Needs to static cast them back to what type of function it was 
Class hierarchy with virtual functions

V-pointer ->base class -> derived class
When standard card c {..};
Is called it makes that 
For every polymorphic class you get a virtual table 
The v pointer will point to one of the tables based on the derived class you make and it looks at the tables to call 
This is low level c 
Nm is command line with executable will show stuff from the executable 
Nm war
Look up gdb
Polymorphism 
Isn't about classes or types but about function behaviors
Void print(car & c)
Is polymorphic cuz all cards can go into it
It accepts may shapes or card to output
Subtype polymorphism 
Can accept any subtype of an “object” print c takes any sub class of card
ad  hoc polymorphism 
“As needed” 
Provide defritianal as you need them sin(x)
If we want to do it for float we make one for float and doubles, long doubles, ecta 
Float sin(float)
Double sin(double)
Template function use this type of ad hoc polymorphism 
template<PnPramma T> 
Void f (T x){
sin(x)}
Practice polymorphism 
Kind of like templates 
Look up this on wiki
They all blend together
With out class hierarchy we can take out suit to other card class
Need sc is abstract as well (no full representation of car from it)  
If it only takes Hearts for a function then we get compiler error if its not Herat 
Hacky way to save the safety of our cards if we try to use wrong type is in the function
Void sort(vector<clubs>&)
Only takes clubs in preconditions 
Void sort_clubs(vector<sc>&)
Takes all types of std card and had to check if they are clubs 
We can keep going down to rank and all cards are represented by its own class so we have 52 classes to represent the cards 
Gives as ability to limit base use but has no values hold in the class 
So we go down the tree it is called speciation 
We spedhize to strong type a program 
For safety 
Strong types is also for optimization 
We have concrete types to be dispatched to certain functions 
This would allow the game of war to run at compile time 
Compiler can compute with types to for run 
Going up the tree is generatlization 
Oda 
To generalize and specialize a class up and down 
Over generalization 
Should you always build a class overtop of another?
Not everything that shares a values shares commonality and should not be grouped 
Bottom up is on
Top down is better
Start with card and break it up 
Card should not share with int class so it should not go up to a supper class that is card and int 
If you struggle to find a name for something it is not an abstraction 
What is the class generalized cara nd int?
Cardinality of a set 
Is the amount of size of set
Ordinal / cordial number wiki
Font is a racial number but shouldnt be reped likte tuth 
Have implementation classes to make it work 
Json
Javascript but throw away all things 
Have heigheratcial data definition 
Values 
Null object
True / false
Numbers 
Strings 
Arrays
In this it has dynamic array 
[0,”hello”,3.14]
Can have array of arrays 
Objects is a key that maps to another values 
{
“Key” : null,
“A”, : [0,1,2],
“B” : [“X” : “ Y” ]
,,,
}
Set of all json values 
Not finite 
Array after array is an infinite 
Strings are infinite 
Number are finite on computer
Object is an unordered hash table 
A map with keys and values 
Just represented as hash table 
Has take hand led with pointers 
If its not pointer it is object slicing 
We effectively make a large tree that keeps going 
Practice 5
Implement object oriented card 
Due in a week
Go all the way to absolute bottom of tree
