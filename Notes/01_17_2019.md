* Object oriented is outdated for everything to be an object 
  * That's why java is bad
  * Garbage collection is a part of classes
  * Has lot of overhead
* Unity is moving away from object oriented for games since it takes a lot to run so performance
* Modularity, abstraction / abstract, encapsulation
  * Modularity
    * Modular building
    * Functions and classes that can be reused elsewhere
    * Small code that can be used over is a little module 
    * Notation of module is close to a class
    * Function that fit together in a module
    * If it is not module it is garbage
    * Decomposition
      * How you decompose the software into modules depends on your programming paradigm
        * Decompose into lost of little functions
    * Vector implementation
      * Has three pointers
        * Point at beginning
        * Point at right after end
        * Point capacity
          * To say how many in array
      * The class countries together the data and the functions that operate on it
      * Either have related functions or classes 
        * Those are 2 types of modules
  * Abstraction
    * Opposite of concrete
      * Which means there is an implementation of code there and refers directly to the code
    * Stack is an abstract data type
      * Behavior of the stack is based on implementation
        * What happens if stack is empty
    * Tells you what you can access but not what it does specifically
    * Abstraction is a process
      * How to represent the modules
    * Levels of abstraction
      * If you work close with the facility of machine it is low level abstraction
        * Dealing with memory allocation
          * If it is more of an idea such as making a game with how it works is high level of abstraction 
            * A class of grouping that controls turn order
  * Encapsulation
    * Is about creating boundaries
    * Making nice grouping that have clear what the objects are doing 
      * Hiding implementation of things so it can be thought abstractly and not what they are doing concistitly 
      * And enforce the idea of not being able to change the implementation
    * You want to make code more abstract to get people to know what it is doing not how it works
    * Generalization
      * It works on more things
      * Overload a function or make it a template to be used for other types extra
      * Specialization is about ballining dowing to be used once
* 3 things we optimize for
  * Correctness
    * Getting the right input output
  * Reduce potential bugs from others
    * Limit access from implementation 
    * This is safety
  * Performance
    * It executes prolicialtyl
    * We optimize for this the most
  * Productivity
    * Used to get programmer to work faster with still being done right
  * Usability
    * How easy is it to use
