* Built in types
  * Int 
    * 32 bit approximation of a whole number
    * Signed and unsigned
      * Unsigned is not approximation 
        * Goes from 0 - 4 bill 
  * Double 	
    * 64 bits
  * Float
    * 32 bits
  * 2^10=1024
    * Is a kilobyte kb
    * 2^20
      * Is a megabyte mb
    * 2^30
      * Is a gigabyte gb
    * 2^40
      * Is a terabyte tb
    * Know the first 10 powers of 2
    * 2^26 = 64 mb
      * 2^6 = 64 * 2^20 = mb
  * Unsigned 
    * Rings of numbers
      * They cycle around
      * Abstract algebra
      * Multiplying 2 unsigned ints they could cycle around and become undefined behavior since the product is less then both of the ones being multiplied 
  * Char
    * Represents low 7 bits of ASCII 
      * Not signed or unsigned
    * 8 bits
      * -128 to 127
      * Or unsigned 0 - 265
  * \* pointers are the set of memory addresses an abstraction 
    * We represent it as 
    * 0xFF
      * Equivalent 0b11111111
      * =255
        * As an int
        * These are the bit representation 
          * F=15 
          * 15*15=255
    * Int &
      * Reference type
      * Allies to an object
        * Bind the name to an object 
        * May or may not be a pointer 
        * Compiler will remove local reference since it does not need to be a pointer
      * Pointers to point at different types are distinct and disjoint sets
        * Can have int*** 
          * Which is a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to an int
            * Will be a 2D matrix of arrays in memory
        * You can make any boolean an int and an int to a boolean 
          * True = 1
            * False = 0
          * Or true = any non zero 
            * False = 0
          * Can promote int to float 
            * But not other way around
          * Addresses shouldn’t be converted into anything else 
            * What would you do with the address as int and why
* Enums
  * These also are a set of types
    * User defined types
  * We don’t care about underlying representations since they are just labels
    * We may care latter
  * Function
    * Takes input gives outputs
      * Maps inputs and maps outputs
    * Total function 
      * give any input and get a valid output 
    * Partial function	
      * Gives only right answer with correct input
    * In is the domain and out is the range / codomain / inage
  * Card does not have a real relationship between suit and rank it more just has those things
    * No comparison like an int being subset of a float
    * Subtyping is the topic to look up for this 
  * How to fake enums
    * If language does not have them
    * Make a struct with static ints
      * Static means that the variable (or function) is not bound to (or part of) the object
        1. struct Suit {
 	      2.  static int Hearts = 0;
 	      3.  int Suit; //store one of the bol S
 	      4.  Suit (int S)
 		    5     : Suit(S)//directly initialize suit from S
 	      6.  {}
        7. };
        * Can use like namespace 
        * Related to class but not part of the object
        * This is the c++ way and immediately calls S constructor 
        * Does not have guard yet for Suit S2=-1;
        * Call by Suit S1 = Suit::Hearts;
        * Change constructor to check the int
        1. Suit(int S)
 	      2.  :Suit (S)
        3. {
 	      4.  if(S<0 || S>3)
 		    5.    std::abort();//if it is wrong just quit
        6. }
          * Not designed
          * Or just catech to catch the error
            1. If….
 	          2. Throw std::runtime_error(“invalid”);
          * But program should not resume running after it broke
          * The throw is for something is wrong with the system (runtime error)
            * We have a logic error so 
              * throw std::logic_error(“invaliade”);
    * Can also default to a suit
      * S=Hearts;
        * We have lots of hearts now
        * Don’t ever do this 
        * We are hiding a bug 
          * We don't know why the program is wrong 
          * Need real good reason to do this
        * Never use cout!!!
          * So we don't know where the error was or if it ever gets printed out
            * Not principled approach use others things
            * Throw / abort / assert
* Abort is best way
  * Or use assert(S<0 || S>3);
    * Software engineering
    * Remove entire condition for you do it
