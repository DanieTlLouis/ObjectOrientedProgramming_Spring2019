Optional(T) / Maybe
* It may return a value but does not have to bees
* Other languages have 
    * Nullable Types
        * C# has it maybe 
        * Take same place
        * T? Makes it questionable 
* Pointers are 4 value
    * An address
    * Null ptr
    * United pointer
        * T * P
            * Indeterminate value address
               * Could be anything 
        * Can do a[ ] = {1,2,3};
           * At 3 will point one past which will work as if it was end()
           * Don't dereference 
        * Idk the 4th
        
Inheritance
* With our car class when we create an object we create an object in memory so it has been both standard card part and the base class part base class
   * The base class will have everything the base case has
   * When we point to this class object will point to the base card with out knowing the rest maybe there
      * standardCArd s(...);
      * Card * c=&s;
         * C will have everything of the base class of s but not access of the derived class part 
   * If we have a function
      * Void four (card & c);
         * If we call four with c 
         * four(*c)
         * We can only access the card part so we only can access it memory since card was empty 
         * The memory of c is still a standard card
               * This is called its static type (what it was declared as)
               * Static type of this card is a card so it can only do card things even if it points to a standardCard
      * If you call a otherCard
         * four(J); //J is a joker card
         * Dynamic type is what the card is at run time
               * Either a jokerCard or a card
       * Do anything useful in four we need to know what type its going to be dynamic type
       
Example
* Static and dynamic types will be on test 
* Look up wiki on cop to get dudes name
* Dynamic type is what is declared at first so when deck initializes its dynamic types s (or Jc)
   * How do we print deck
      * If dynamic type is one we need to do this else print joker
         * How do we query the dynamic type
         * Gi the base class a tag to announce what it is
               * Enum kind {
                   * Standard, joker}
         * We can explicitly initialize base class with i s
               * standardCard(Rank r, Suit s) : Card(standard)
                   * Calls constructor of card with argument of kind 
   * We need to take c and deancast it to make it a card type
      * A reference can be astatuccast 
      * Take a pointer to base class and we can convert it to the derived class 
         * We know that c will be a standard card 
      * static_cast<stadardCard const &>(c);
* Card should hold as much as possible so we can use it in other algorithms and change / add calls without needing to change algorithms 
   * Switch is faster than going over a bunch of if statements
* Switches is a go to 	
   * Go toâ€™s are a loranch to instruction label is the address of an instruction 
   * Label:
      * Goto label;
      * Everything can be if or switch 
         * It will get int and go to the corresponding int
      * If statement have to check each if statement but switch jumps to the right caSE
         * Switch does not check every case it just goes to the one
         * We can only switch on with ints or things represented by ints
            * Always a constant time jump
   * Put enum into class
      * Tagged hierarchy
      * Need to use :: to reference it 
      
Real oop way (bad for performance)
Cant ask system what the dynamic type and we should only do the static type of the card we should only do the static type of the call
We want to tell the card to print itself so the card will know how the print it to self allocate what it is 
The object knows what it is even if you don't
Put print in card
Struct card{
Void print(std::ostream& os) const{
This will be told by compiler what to do and create a static dispatch system but we want it at run time to call dynamic batching 
This is a virtual function to say what it will be 
We do need overrides for dynamic types 
Virtual void print(std::osteam & os) const
In standardCard
Virtual void print 
This is the override (not overwrite) 
Says it can be overridden function so it calls that one instead
In C++ 11 or 14 and on you can use key words override at end to explicitly call override function 
Void pring(std::osteam & os)const override{
When compiler sees its virtual it goes to the dynamic type and finds its override call	
Triple A games says this overhead is to bad
Assert is not a function so
[(asset : false)]; is new way to call it
Does not actually get ride of it in release made it is just ignored 
Can do this for all parts of card and make them virtual and override them per class static_cast<color>(suit>diamond);
If suit is greater then diamond it returns 1 and converts that 1 into a color so it will be red
Pure virtual function
In class card 
virtual void print(...) const = 0;
Defined to have no behavior 
Abstract method 
Can not create object of the class anymore
No behavior associated with that type new it is just an abstract
